Applying the DeepLearning course knowledge & example prompts on Groq for checking the model accuracy [Link](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/chatgpt-prompt-eng/lesson/dfbds/introduction)

Prompting Principles
 * **Principle 1: Write clear and specific instructions**
 
    * Tactic 1: Use delimiters to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input
    - Delimiters can be anything like: ```, """, < >, `<tag> </tag>`, `:`

    * Tactic 2: Ask for a structured output
    *- JSON, HTML

    * Tactic 3: Ask the model to check whether conditions are satisfied

    * Tactic 4: "Few-shot" prompting

 * **Principle 2: Give the model time to “think”**

    * Tactic 1: Specify the steps required to complete a task

    * Tactic 2: Instruct the model to work out its own solution before rushing to a conclusion
